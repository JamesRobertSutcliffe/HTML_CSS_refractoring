## HTML, CSS and Git Refractoring

## Description

The task of the project was to refactor code for a website to a more accessible, succinct and logical format. I undertook this project in order to gain a more in depth understanding of HTML and CSS. The project highlighted the importance of using semantic HTML and how to logically and efficently build a working HTML / CSS webpage. I learned how to properly format
a HTML and CSS site with semantic tags and various attribute choices that can be chosen. I also learned how to use HTML and CSS in an efficent manner whilst utilising the git workflow.
